    <h1>what are the ways of selecting elements form DOM?</h1>
    <p><span>Answer:</span>
      We can select elemnts by different methods using JavaScript. Some of them are described below: <br>
        
      1. getElementsById(): We can use this method to select a html element with specific ID. For example if an element has id of "new-id". 
        we can select the element from html document using document.getElementsByTagName("new-id"). <br>

      2. getElementsByClassName(): We can use this method to select a html elements with specific classes. For example if one or more element has class of "new-class". 
        we can select those elements from html document using document.getElementsByClassName("new-class").<br>

      3. getElementsByTagName(): We can use this to select html elements with same tag name. For example we can select all h1 elements from html document using document.getElementsByTagName("h1"). <br>
      
      4. querySelector(): This one select the first element that matches the specified CSS selector in the document. For example document.querySelector('li'), document.querySelector('.heading') will
        select the first element which matches the query.<br>
    
      5. querySelectorAll(): This one select list of all elements that matches the specified elemnts. document.querySelectorAll('.heading') will select all the elements with class name heading.<br>
